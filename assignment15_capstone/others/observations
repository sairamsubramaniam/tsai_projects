1) scannet_scene.ScanNet class's __getitem__ function takes in imageIndex as input (and in the ScanNet dataset, one scene had 1000 images!)

2) For each image, there should be a corresponding segmentation.png, depth.png, pose.txt and instance-filt.png (semantics)

3) Extrinsics comes from posePath

4) planeDepths are calculated by using planes.npy (Nx3) tensor. planeDepths are of the shape - SegmentationImage HeightxWidthx Num planes.

5) planeOffsets = are plane coordinates' (the Nx3 tensor) distances calculated using np.linalg.norm

6) planeNormals = are planes divided by planeOffsets

7) parameters = is the difference between planeNormals - ANCHOR_NORMALS (anchor_planes_N.npy) for the selected plane

8) class_ids are closely related to planes - planes (3 coordinates) are stacked in the order of class_ids

9) mask is all segmentation (plane mask ?) tensors stacked along the channel axis

10) Bounding boxes are extracted from the mask

11) image_meta has image_id, image shape, image window coordinates and active class_ids

12) What are active_class_ids - In my case??

13) `target_mask` is an array of just 1s and 0s with the shape num_instances x 28 x 28
