Studying the networks
---------------------

I tried printing the network structure and they look like this:
  - `Planercnn <https://github.com/sairamsubramaniam/tsai_projects/blob/master/assignment15_capstone/network_reference/planercnn>`_
  - `Midas <https://github.com/sairamsubramaniam/tsai_projects/blob/master/assignment15_capstone/network_reference/midas>`_
  - `YoloV3 <https://github.com/sairamsubramaniam/tsai_projects/blob/master/assignment15_capstone/network_reference/yolo_network>`_

Next step was to take the first two networks and join them as described in the "approach" section.

To do that, I first extracted weights from Midas using this notebook
